Welcome to this tutorial.

It is your job to protect the torch you are carrying. Enemies will try to quench its fire. It will slowly run out of fuel over time.

Torches you come by will get lit to help you navigate. Scoured ares will show up on the minimap. 

Along the way you will find chests. They may contain torch fuel, new weapons or power ups. Press XXX to open a chest.

Use the XXX on your controller to swith weapons, and XXX to fire! 
Now brace yourself for your first enemy!

Enemies will spawn around you and will do anything to extinguish the fire you're carrying.

You will encounter more types of enemies along your quest. As well as other challenges.

It is your goal to reach the center of the earth and rekindle its fire.

Be ware: the stairs downward will only open when you have collected all keys in the level.
